description = "IoTone, Inc. is based in the Silicon Valley, and is focused on building the platform for Unified Intelligence: a single platform for deploying AI onto cloud, desktop, mobile, and IoT.  We call the platform BiotKit.  For <i>developers</i>, it saves time, and simplifies deployment.  For <i>device makers</i>, it reduces time to market and provides a built in ecosystem.  For <i>consumers</i> it means you can interact with devices and the world around you more intelligently, without swipes, clicks, or confirmation dialogs.  The platform will be open source, and the AI will be available on a market for exchange, where all participants in the ecosystem can build, try, buy, and exchange sentient intelligence."
